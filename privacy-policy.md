# Privacy Policy for "Copy SMS Code"

**Effective Date:** May 14, 2025  
**Developer:** Dekame  
**Contact:** <medevjd@gmail.com>

## Overview

This Privacy Policy describes how the "Copy SMS Code" application (hereafter referred to as “the App”) handles user data. The App is published by **Dekame** on the Google Play Store and is available under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html).

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

The App does **not collect**, **store**, **transmit**, or **share** any personal or sensitive user data. All necessary settings are stored **locally** on the user's device.

- **No Internet Permission**: The App does not request or use internet access. Therefore, no user data leaves your device through the App.
- **No Analytics**: The App does not use any analytics or telemetry services such as Google Analytics or Facebook SDK.
- **No Ads**: The App does not include advertisements or ad SDKs.
- **No Third-Party Sharing**: The App does not share data with third parties.

### System-Level Backups (Android OS)

If you have enabled **“Backup & Reset”** on your Android device (Settings > Backup & Reset > Back up my data), the Android operating system may back up application settings to Google servers. This is a system-level function outside the App's control. The App's developers do not have access to these backups.

## 2. Data Security

As the App does not collect or store any user data externally, there is no risk of server-side data breaches or unauthorized data access through the App. All data remains on the device under the control of the user and the Android operating system.

## 3. Data Retention and Deletion

Since no data is collected or stored remotely, there is no retention of user data. Uninstalling the App will delete all locally stored settings and configurations. No further action is required to delete any associated data.

## 4. Privacy Inquiries

If you have any questions or concerns about privacy while using the App, please contact the developer:
