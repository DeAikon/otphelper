- "One Time Password" sensitive keyword now can contain dashes
- hebrew sensitive keyword "קוד" no longer matches partially
- Removed "Ignore" action from notification and Added "Ignore App" and "Ignore Tag" actions instead
- Removed "Copy" action button from notification to make room for translation of mentioned actions (pressing the notification still copies the code)
